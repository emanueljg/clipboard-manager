## clipboard-manager

Do you hate copy/pasting the same things over and over again? Do you wish that there were
some way to make some common things *just stick* in the computers memory, to easily be recalled
through short-hand syntax? Clipboard Manager aims to do just that. 

Being accessed anywhere by a 
customizable global hotkey (by default `ctrl+alt+<`), the Clipboard Manager can store any placeholder
key and value. One `add mail emanueljohnsongodin@gmail.com` later, and then, every time you type
`§§mail` *(configurable prefix)*, `emanueljohnsongodin@gmail.com` is inserted. The possibilities are **truly** endless!
